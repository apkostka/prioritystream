== PriorityStream
  
App which shows a timeline of workable project hours, separated by current tasks. The timeline shows, based on priority and hourly estimates, which tasks will be completed on which dates. The app will assume a certain number or workable hours per day, multiplied by the number of available developers.  
  
Task priority can be shifted up or down, which will alter the timeline (hopefully without creating a paradox). When a task's priority is shifted, the task owner and the assigned developer will be notified. Tasks will be color-coded based on the project manager (AE) that owns it.
